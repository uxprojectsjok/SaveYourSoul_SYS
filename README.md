# SaveYourSoul (SYS)

**Protocol, not a product.**

SYS defines a portable user context protocol for AI systems. The core unit is the **soul.md** — a Markdown file with YAML frontmatter that encodes a personal identity profile.

It is stored locally in the user's browser, evolves over time through interactions, and provides structured context for AI systems.

This repository contains the protocol specification and a reference implementation running at [sys.uxprojects-jok.com](https://sys.uxprojects-jok.com). The reference implementation is invite-only and serves as an example implementation only. It is not intended as a deployable product. Any compatible implementation can be built independently.

> Think of it like email: the protocol is open, and the reference implementation is only one possible server implementation.

## Core Concept

```
soul.md  →  sessionStorage (browser)  →  never leaves without user action
         →  VPS (encrypted, AES-256-CBC, user-initiated)
         →  AI context (Anthropic Claude API, transient, user-initiated)
         →  MCP tools (soul_read / soul_write, authorized per token)
```

The soul.md belongs to the user. The operator has no access to encrypted content. Encryption is the default, plaintext is an explicit opt-in.

## Core Identity

_Who is this person in one sentence?_

## Values ​​& Beliefs

_What motivates them? What do they believe in?_

## Aesthetics & Resonance

_Music, atmospheres, visual stimuli that attract this person._

## Speech Patterns & Expression

_How do they speak? How does she write?_

## Recurring Themes & Obsessions

_What keeps coming back to her?_

## Emotional Signature

_What is it like to talk to her?_

## Worldview

_How does she see the world? What is her view of humanity?_

## Unanswered Questions from this Person

_What is she still looking for?_

## Session Log (compressed)

...

## Calendar

...
```

Full specification: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Authentication

All protected endpoints use HMAC-SHA256 soul_cert tokens — stateless, no database:

```
cert   = HMAC-SHA256(SOUL_MASTER_KEY, soul_id).hex()[:32]
bearer = soul_id + "." + soul_cert
```

---

## MCP Integration

`soul-mcp/` implements the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) with OAuth 2.0 + PKCE. Claude, or any MCP-compatible AI client, can connect and access soul.md and vault files with granular permissions.

Key tools: `soul_read`, `soul_write`, `vault_manifest`, `audio_list`, `network_list`

---

## Self-Hosting

The production stack uses OpenResty (nginx + LuaJIT) as the API layer — no Node.js in production. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component breakdown and [docs/PRODUCTION_SETUP.md](docs/PRODUCTION_SETUP.md) for implementation notes.

There is no install script. The specification is complete; the engineering is up to the implementer.

## Status

- **Concept project** — living proof-of-concept, not a commercial product
- **Reference implementation** — invite-only, experimental, no warranty
- **Protocol** — Apache 2.0, compatible implementations welcome
